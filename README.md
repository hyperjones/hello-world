# hello-world
just another repository
Hello,
it's been 2 months since I started learning to code with my super laggy laptop. I'm learning HTML, CSS and javaScript  and I want to learn more! CSS positioning always gives me headache and sometimes like I wanna  give up learning codes! (sorry for my English. I'm not a native English speaker hehe)
